                The breakdown I give here will be greatly influence by my own 12-years experience<br>as  a web deverloper and interaction with several other top-notch web designer in Nigeria.<br>
                The cost of creating  a website can be divided into 4 basic categories Those include;<br></center>
               <center>•Domain Name,<br></center>
               <center>•Hosting fee,<br></center> 
               <center>•Programmer’s fee.<br></center> 
                <center>Note: SSL certificate is now  a must for all browsers and search engines.<br>
                So if your site doesn’t have it it will be flagged as insecured.<br>
                That alone is a big dent on your reputation. So, therefore ,it’s now  a must-have feature.<br>

                Also beware that since there is no fixed price, I will stick to price ranges.<br>
